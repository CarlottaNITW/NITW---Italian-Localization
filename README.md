# Night in the Woods - ENG>ITA Localization Project

This repository contains a non-commercial localization project of the narrative videogame *Night in the Woods*, developed as part of a Master's thesis in Translation at the University of Turin (2024).

## About the Project

The `.yarn` dialogue files were extracted and fully translated from English to Italian, with great care given to tone, character voice, slang, wordplay, and cultural references. Re-insertion of translated content into the game was performed using an open-source CLI tool released by the French fan localization community. The Italian version was fully functional in-game and presented to the academic commission as a working proof of concept for game localization workflows.
