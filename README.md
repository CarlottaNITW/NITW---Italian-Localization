# Night in the Woods - ENG>ITA Localization Project

This repository contains a non-commercial localization project of the narrative videogame *Night in the Woods*, developed as part of a Master's thesis in Translation at the University of Turin (2024).

## About the Project

The `.yarn` dialogue files were extracted from the game files and fully translated from English to Italian, with great care given to tone, character voice, slang, wordplay, and cultural references. Re-insertion of translated content into the game was performed using an open-source CLI tool released by the French fan localization community (available at https://github.com/emberimp/NITW-Dialogue-Tool) The Italian version was fully functional in-game and presented to the academic commission as a working proof of concept for game localization workflows.

## Dialogue List

This folder contains materials related to the translation and adaptation of four selected scenes from the videogame. It showcases both textual and visual elements that highlight the linguistic and cultural challenges involved in the process.

### dialogue_list.pdf

The main file in this folder is a PDF document featuring:

- Tables with the **original English text** and its **Italian adaptation** for four different scenes from the game.
- A selection of **nonsense poetry excerpts**, accompanied by translated versions that aim to preserve the playful and surreal tone of the original.
- **Translation proposals** for a visual element central to the player's experience: the **in-game journal**, where the protagonist records progress through humorous and expressive doodles.

This document illustrates the translator’s strategy to maintain the stylistic identity of the game while adapting it for an Italian-speaking audience.

### Visual Journal Adaptation

This subfolder expands on the proposals presented in the main PDF file, offering visual examples of how the journal might look in Italian.

#### journal_screenshots/

A collection of mock-up screenshots that show the journal as it would appear in the translated version. These images aim to recreate the original tone, style, and humor using Italian text and culturally adapted visuals.

#### modded_clip.mp4

A short gameplay clip, showing a humorous wordplay, personally modded by the author. This video serves as a proof of concept for how the localization could be implemented inside the game itself.
